# textbox.page

A simple textbox for pasting text into and editing. Preserves contents between page reloads and also provides some nifty stats at the bottom.

Sometimes you just need to paste something somewhere. Rather than opening your notepad app or a code editor, go to textbox.page and paste it there.

It has a code mode and writing mode. The code mode supports tabbing.

I'd love it if you would contribute! Keep it to one file (index.html) and no dependencies.

## Deployment

Just run `now --target production`. You'll have to have access to my Now.sh instance, of course.
